# CursiveRec
Python GUI Application that recognizes cursive writing

# Features:
* __Recognition :__ Recognizes lower-case cursive alphabets and numbers using single-stroke gestures
* __User customization :__ Users can add their own set of gestures (and can save them for later)
* __Copy to Clipboard :__ Recognized letters can be copied to clipboard
<br/>
NOTE: You can keep recognizing letters/digits one-by-one without clearing the canvas. <br/>
      The interface will append each gesture for you <br/>
